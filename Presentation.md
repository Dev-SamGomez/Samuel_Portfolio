Hi, I'm Samuel Gomez, a Software Development Engineering student, I'm 23 years old and I currently work as a Junior Engineer in a maquiladora company as a Software Developer. We develop web systems and desktop applications for Windows, in .NET. In this company I have collaborated in 5 projects together with other developers, and 1 project, made from scratch and without collaborations by me, which was developed in .NET.

I have been working as a software developer, especially Backend programming, for 2 years, I have experience in development in the following programming languages:

   - JavaScript.
   - PHP.
   - VisualBasic
   - C#.
   - C++.

In addition to having experience in database, and data structure, using:

   - Microsoft SQLServer.
   - MySql.

In addition to having knowledge in Office, functional programming, object-oriented programming, MVC, Arduino. I continue to obtain knowledge and always improve my programming logic, for which I have Platzi certificates, as well as continue studying on said platform.

In addition to one of my goals in the workplace, it is to learn programming oriented to video games, since this is my goal of being a video game developer, I continue to learn a lot from this type of programming.

In this portfolio, I will show usage examples in different programming languages, and some visuals on Github Pages, as well as attach full projects that I collaborate on or create.

Without further ado, welcome to my portfolio.
